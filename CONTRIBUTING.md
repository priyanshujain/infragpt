```

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

1. **Tests Workflow**: Runs on every PR and push to master
   - Installs the package
   - Verifies it can be imported
   - Checks package structure

2. **Publish Workflow**: Automatically publishes to PyPI
   - Triggers on pushes to the master branch
   - Requires PyPI secrets to be configured in GitHub

### Setting up PyPI Publishing

1. Create an API token on PyPI:
   - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - Create a token with "Entire account (all projects)" scope
2. Add the token as a GitHub secret:
   - Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Create a new repository secret named `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
   - Paste your PyPI API token as the value

## Local Development
